## Gnucash

Simple opensource software to balance checkbooks. I have used this in the past, but recently, I have been trying to use it for every day transactions.
While reading a book, I came across some things I wanted to note down.

## Tabs and such

I am trying to keep a couple of tabs open for some accounts and reports. By keeping a report open for my reconciled transactions, I hope it
will help me answer questions of where money is going.

## Entry

So far entry has been a pain, but I just came across some shortcuts that I want to capture.

| Shortcut    | Action                               |
| ----------- | -----------                          |
| +           | to increment the date                |
| -           | to decrement the date                |
| ]           | to increment the month               |
| [           | to decrement the month               |
| m           | to enter the first date of the month |
| h           | to enter the last date of the month  |
| y           | to enter the first date of the year  |
| r           | to enter the last date of the year   |
| t           | to enter todays date                 |

* switching tabs: Ctrl+Alt+PgUp/PgDn
* enter to move to next transaction
