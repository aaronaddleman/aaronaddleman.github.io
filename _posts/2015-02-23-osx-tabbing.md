While mashing some buttons this morning I found a new way to tab through applications and while doing so, displays the windows that are open. I really like this feature as I can now use one button to cycle through the applications that are open and see a nice full screen of all windows for that application.

To achieve this, use the following keys:

1. CMD + Tab
1. Keep CMD held down
1. CMD + 1
1. Should see windows for current application zoom to a preview mode
1. Now you can let go of CMD
1. Hit the ` button and notice your cycling through applications!
