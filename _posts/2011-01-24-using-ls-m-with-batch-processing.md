<p>While looking through the manual pages on ls for setting my .profile settings, I found an option that I have never used or heard about before.
The -m option lists the contents on one line separated by a space and a comma! OMG this is amazing because I have been piping my output to the utility of xargs to making it be on one line. So by using -m and combining awk, I think I can cut some characters of bash code down by a small chunk.</p>
