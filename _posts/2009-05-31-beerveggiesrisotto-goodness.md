# beer+veggies+risotto = goodness

Dinner tonight was fun! Risotto, with some grilled veggies and fantastic beer from our local pub. Now that I live closer to the pub, we picked up a 12 case of bottled beer for fun consumption. I have to say, the Irish Red Ale is super good!
While grilling the veggies and enjoying my beers, I had a fun time hanging out in the back yard of our house and passing the time =)
