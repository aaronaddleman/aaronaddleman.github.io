<p>To capture the essence of current style and functionality for the digital person, this takes the cake. Keeping a monitor at home and having the laptop as your source of computing to save space.

<li>slim</li>
<li>bold colors</li>
<li>cable management</li>
<li>minimal</li>
</ol>
I am very impressed with this desk and would totally get one right away if I did not already have a desk system of my own.
The idea of taking steel and making a desk with powder coat finish, good idea.
