This plug-in is meant for a vim enthusiast who does not like to use the mouse. Every now and then I remember that I have this add on installed and I try to use it but then end up forgetting the features that are so helpful. At [vimum homepage](http://vimium.github.io/) they list all of the commands that are usable but for my own sake, I have to have a cheatsheet that helps me out with scenarios:

## Browsing

By far this is the most powerful part of the add on. Browsing links with your keyboard.

> <kbd>f</kbd> Brings up letters for every link on the current page. Type the letters and the link is clicked.

> <kbd>F</kbd> Same as the lowercase but opens the link in a new tab.

When you want to open new new url, use the following:

> <kbd>o</kbd> Will prompt for a new url to open.

> <kbd>O</kbd> Will prompt for a new url to be opened in a new tab.



## History

Everyone does this. Browse a link and then say "ack, thats not what I was looking for!" and hit the back button. Instead do this:

> <kbd>H</kbd> Go backwards in history

> <kbd>L</kbd> Go forwards in history

## Tabs

Here are the commands that are useful for moving back and forth between tabs. 

> <kbd>K</kbd> Go forwards one tab

> <kbd>J</kbd> Go backwards one tab

> <kbd>t</kbd> Make a new tab

> <kbd>x</kbd> Close current tab

> <kbd>X</kbd> Restore closed tab

## Scrolling
