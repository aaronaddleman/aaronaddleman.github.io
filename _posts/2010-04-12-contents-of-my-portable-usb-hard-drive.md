I have started to invest some time and attention to making my programming and development area to be portable for any word that involves the Windows environment. Over the months, I have built up a nice collection of the applications that have been useful to my job and have really been handy in tough spots. So here is a list of the applications I use:

* 2xClient (remote desktop for windows)
* 7-Zip (much faster than regular zip)
* ActiveStateKomodoEdit (fantastic editor for ruby on rails)
* Aptana Studio (good editor for ruby on rails, but not used&nbsp;often)
* Audactiy (audio editor)
* FileZilla (FTP client)
* FireFox
* FreeCommander (kind of like midnight commander, but for windows)
* GIMP (image editor)
* gVim (slim text editor)
* InfraRecorder (burning software)
* KeePass (for all my passwords)
* Lightscreen (very nice screen capturing software with some nice bells)
* PuTTY (tty client for ssh and serial connections)
* TeamViewer (really nice remote desktop application and very easy to setup with another person)
* ThunderBird
* UnetBootin (usb boot manager)
* WinDirStat (find those big files)
* winMd5Sum (check the file integrity when&nbsp;transferring&nbsp;stuff)
* WinMerge (diff file and directory utility)
* WinSCP (ssh copy)
* WinWGet (wget for windows)
