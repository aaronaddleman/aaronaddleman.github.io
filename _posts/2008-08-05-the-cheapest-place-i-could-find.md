<p>The Goldcoast Casino was the cheapest place I could find that is next to my friends staying in Las Vegas. Today I woke up. Got some breakfast. Played some Warcraft. Went back to my room to freashen up from sleeping over night at friends apartment and found water sitting in the sink of my hotel room! Nasty!
