While riding my bike in Amsterdam, I wanted to capture how all the bikes travel around. This one of the many paths around the entire city where the bikes have their own lane and pedestrians have theirs. Also, many posts and metal structures are all around town to allow for an anchor point to store you bike during the ... day, week, month, year... 2 years or more!
