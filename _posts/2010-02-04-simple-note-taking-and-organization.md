<p>I have really found <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> to be of great help. I have been using them on a usb memory stick for a couple months now and have grown to like it for capturing data, links and other info.
My favorite things about the TiddlyWiki are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Its all in one html file</li>
<li>Searching is fast</li>
<li>Composing a note is simple</li>
<li>Notes can have references
<ol>
<li>this makes for an option of opening all of the relative notes at one time (very cool)</li>
<li>linking notes together with out having to type specific info into the note itself</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Timeline shows what you have been working on recently</li>
<li>Orphans show unused notes</li>
</ol>
I am sure there are plenty more benefits to using the <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddleWiki</a> system. If you have any, please add them to the comments!
