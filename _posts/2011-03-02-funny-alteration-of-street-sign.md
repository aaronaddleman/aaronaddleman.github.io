<p>While riding the bus to work, I got a good chance to take a picture of a street sign that has been altered but still keeps the message. I hope kids and parents don't follow it's example. <br><br><a href="/assets/files/20110302-091836.jpg"><img src="/assets/files/20110302-091836.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full" href="/assets/files/20110302-091836.jpg"></a></p>
