<a href="/assets/files/picture-4.png"></a>This is the 2nd wallpaper decoration that I have to say is very cool! The first wallpaper that I got into is called <a href="http://www.whatisblik.com/">Blik</a> that I found out about from a good friend of mine. Blik are stickers that work best on a flat wall surface and display some great graphics using white space and simple shapes to create large, wonderful decals for your wall. Some of the Bliks are able to go onto glass cups to give your party a lil color spark!
But this 2nd wallpaper item is one that emits light! However I do not know the properties behind how they are doing this (becuase its details are not yet released).
