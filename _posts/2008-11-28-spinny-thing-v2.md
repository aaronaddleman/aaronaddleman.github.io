I made this image a long time ago in the Core Image Fun House program that comes with the developer tools on Mac OSX. The finished product really shocked me as how you can really make some cool stuff in there, but if I had only tracked my progress along the way, I would be able to make more images just like this. So, lesson learned here: write down how to do stuff when things start looking cool.
