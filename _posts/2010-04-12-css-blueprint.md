<p>A CSS framework has many&nbsp;benefits. To name a few:</p>  <ol>
<li>lego-like-layouts: all of your content is built with the same spacing</li>  <li>multiple developers: everyone has agreed on the same methods to setup content (avoid duplication)</li>  <li>organized: bringing the css into a organized format</li>  </ol>
<p>I have tried out some pages with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a>&nbsp;and so far have really enjoyed its setup.</p>      <p style="font-size: 10px;">
