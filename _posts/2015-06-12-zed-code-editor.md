## Zed Code Editor

This is a great editor. I am still getting used to how it all works, but it has been well worth my time as there have been moments in my recent life that I wanted to make that change to a file and did not have a good editor, or no git, or just a browser, and could not commit that edit.

This post was made with the Zed Code Editor!
