<p>I found this video about how you can use a 3D camera to capture your body motions and manipulate your character on SecondLife. I also found another piece of technology that will project SecondLife characters in 3D onto objects. This might be an interesting future for the home in about 10 to 20 years. Where we will interact with each other between two or more distance locations.
