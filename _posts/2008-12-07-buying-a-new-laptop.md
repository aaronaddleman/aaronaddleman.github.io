A friend of mine asked me if there I had any suggestions for some laptops to look at for buying. So I decided to figure out some options.
<h2>Criteria</h2>
We started out with what they were looking at and also keeping in mind of the following criteria:
<ul>
	<li>Price</li>
	<li>Playing Games</li>
	<li>Storing photos</li>
	<li>Speed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choice</h2>
This list is not in any specific order as they are all equal in making a choice for the laptop. You might notice that weight was not really a factor.
The two computers they started off with was of the following:
<ul>
	<li>HP Pavilion dv7z</li>
	<li>HP Pavilion dv7t</li>
</ul>
I did some searching and found another computer that HP offers, called the G60, but is configured for the quick-ship method and does not allow for configuration. According to HP technical support, it is not possible to change the video card on the laptop. Both the nvidia and intel and ati video cards are integrated into the motherboard.

They both have a decent base price and the features are pretty good. After trying to browse HP's website to compare the two models I found out that the store does not handle moving back and forth between the various options. So I ended up calling HP and trying to figure out the differences between the two.

For the most part, the only difference between the two models is the processor type of either AMD or Intel and the graphics card being either ATI Radeon or NVIDIA.
After browsing around the net for a little bit. I came across another model that might stand up better to the list we have above. The HP G60 has some good hardware and options that are similar to the dv7t with the keyboard, video card, and memory. The only drawback from the G60 is the memory upgrading option. The G60 is only limited by how much memory is available.
<h2>Performance</h2>
I read a couple of days ago that the AMD chip is better than the Intel in various amounts of ways. But I know that Intel has been around longer and I like to trust what works and do not have to worry about incompatibilities. However, I think my friend will not have to worry about that since they mostly use the computer for school and gaming.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
So I think it comes down to a question of the graphics card and which model you can afford. I read up on the NVIDIA vs the ATI and found there have been some <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html;jsessionid=E176A5E95725C328E21BEB341E424005.app05_05?topicId=7475681487&amp;sid=1">problems with world of warcraft and ATI</a>. So I am going to say that the NVIDIA card is going to be the better performer. Having said that, the dv7z would be out of the picture.
<ul>
	<li>Option 1
<ul>
	<li>My first choice would be the dv7t and pour all my money into the graphics card. Then later in the future you can upgrade the memory of the system to 8gb and be rocking hardcore!! w000T! but that will be expensive! (guessing around $500 for the memory alone)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Option 2
<ul>
	<li>If you cant afford that, then I would suggest the G60 with the NVIDIA chip. In the future you will be able to reach a max of 4GB which is still pretty good. You save money, still have the options you like, and it will serve you for a while. Also, it should arrive faster since its a "quick-ship" hp product.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
