<p>The Arduino project is fantastic. I will be making some of these when I get work bench and blend them with some ideas.
Arduino in short, is a circuit board that you can buy or build your self that you can write instructions and have be executed on the piece of circuitry. Projects and makers use this for adding logic to the puzzle. I cant wait!!
