<p>While reading the magazine "Information Security", I came across an article about SaaS (software as a service) and it had 7 questions suggested inside:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Who handles penetration testing, and how is it done?</li>
<li>What are the sign-on, access and authentication policies?</li>
<li>What encryption policies will protect data as it is transfered, or when it is being stored?</li>
<li>Is there a single-tenant hosting option seperated from that of other customers?</li>
<li>Who manages the application on the back end, and what policies are in place to thwart insider breachers?</li>
<li>What is the backup and recovery plan?</li>
<li>How well does the provider's security policy match my company's (if my company has one)?</li>
</ol>
<div>I found all of the questions to be very important and valid.</div>
