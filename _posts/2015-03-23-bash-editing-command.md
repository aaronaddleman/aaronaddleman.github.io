## What

Edit your really long line of command with your editor to make updating easier.

## Why

Take advantage of your editor's power to move/search/modify your command to your editor's heart content.

## How

When running BASH and you our command is way too long, type: CTRL+x e

That is today, hold down ctrl the entire time, type x, then type e.
