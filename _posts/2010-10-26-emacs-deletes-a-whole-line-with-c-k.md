<p>Yep, its just like the title says. But there are some other commands that might be useful with the deleting the whole line which is moving to the top of your document (opps, I should say buffer, to be emacs polite) with the command ESC-&lt;
To review:
</p>
<ul>
<li>C-k &nbsp;delete the entier line</li>
<li>ESC-&lt; &nbsp;move to the top of the buffer</li>
</ul>
