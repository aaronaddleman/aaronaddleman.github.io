Tonight marks the success of my abilities in making ratatouille soup in the pressure cooker. WOW it tastes so good!! One bowl filled me up for the rest of the night. When I diced up all of the vegetables, I thought I must had done something wrong because about half of the veggies were not underneath the liquid, but everything came out great. The tomatos kept a bright red while the zucchini was absolutely perfect consistency. Also, the herbs really came out good but not too over powering. Overall, I have to say I love this recipe and will be making it again for sure! I think it took me about 1 hour over all to cut up the veggies and cook the soup (yah yah im kinda slow...).
Maybe next time I will remember to take pictures or even video.
