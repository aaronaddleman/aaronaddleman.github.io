# Webcam + software = multi-touch control... without touching anything

<p>Controlling your computer by dividing the background and the foreground. Way cool! I'm so tired of moving my hand away from the keyboard and over to the mouse. This guy is using a $30 camera pointing down at his keyboard and software to recognize circles made with his thumb and forefinger. Fantastic!! I hope this takes off and we can start setting up this our selves. Perhaps one gesture could enable different modes and the possibilities could be endless.
