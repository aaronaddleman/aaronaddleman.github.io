# Truck Step Soap Dish [Clever Uses]

<p>This is a great idea! I am storing this away in my future design ideas for the house that I need.

While flipping through a tow truck parts catalog, Lappin spotted the step.  He writes: </p>
<blockquote>We bought one and installed it in the shower I now use daily. This is by far the best-designed soap dish I've ever used. The open front allows water to drain away easily, while the diamond-plate surface secures and elevates the soap so that it dries without creating a lot of yucky soap-gunk. And of course, the aluminum doesn't rust or corrode.</blockquote> Definitely one of the niftiest and unexpected repurposing we've seen in awhile. If you want your own truck step soap dish, <a href="http://www.awdirect.com/recessed-step-7-3-8quotw-x-6-1-4quoth-x-4quotd-sp3002-1/body-hardware/">the part will set you back $35</a>.
