# mTAIL Tracks Log File Changes [Featured Windows Download]

<p>This looks very useful for the sysadmin out there. I have not used it yet, because I am happy so far with BareTail. But I should give this a try the next time I need to read logs on Windows as its updated.

Windows only: Actively track changes in your log files with lightweight application mTAIL, a Windows-based emulation of the venerable <code>tail</code> command found in *nix based operating systems. Instead of opening a log file to review the contents, mTAIL keeps the file open and displays it as the system writes to it. Firewall your attention by setting up filters and alerts in mTAIL based on keywords. The app will cull out events in the log you don't need to see and alert you to the events you've pre-flagged. If you'd like a few more flourishes to go with your <code>tail</code> emulation, check out equally as free <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5069938/baretail-displays-log-files-in-real-time">BareTail</a>. mTAIL is a free download for Windows only. <em>Thanks <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5069938/baretail-displays-log-files-in-real-time#c8685762">Michael Kizer</a>!</em>
