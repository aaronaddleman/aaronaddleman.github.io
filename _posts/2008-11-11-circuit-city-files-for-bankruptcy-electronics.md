<ol>
<li>they did not cover enough home entertainment categories</li>
<li>some stores were left in mess (heck, compusa was better)</li>
<li>employees did not care about the technology (again, compusa was better)</li>
</ol>
And we all know where Compusa went....
<blockquote>Electronics retailer Circuit City has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aXeltuiAOyzs&amp;refer=home">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>, one week after announcing the closing of more than 150 of its 721 U.S. stores. It doesn't look good for the chain's future, so gift card holders should get working toward a zero balance, while Black Friday hounds might be rewarded with some serious move-this-now deals.
