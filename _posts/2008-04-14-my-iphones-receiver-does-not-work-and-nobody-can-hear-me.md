I was talking on my iPhone with a friend and then after I hung up they could not hear me any more!!! WHAT GIVES APPLE!?!?
Okay, don't panic. Take a deep breath and keep reading. There is a solution and its very simple!
If you some how are stuck with your phone not letting you talk to people, its due to a problem of the iPhone not recognizing that you unplugged your headphones that have the built in microphone. This usually happends to me when I unplug the headphones too fast.


## Verify the problem

To make sure that your suck in this mode after you have unplugged your headphones, adjust the volume with the buttons on the side. If you see the visual indicator appear with the title of "heaphones" and your headphones are not plugged in, then the iPhone did not recognize you have unplugged your headphones.

## To Fix the problem

Plug in your headphones. Then SLOWLY unplug your headphones

## Verify Fix of the problem

Adjust the volume without the headphones in the iPhone jack. If you see the visual indicator appear with the title of "ringer" or "speaker" (depending on your model) then you are in good shape and people will hear you.
