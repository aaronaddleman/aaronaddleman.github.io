<p>Another RedMine plugin of mine to automatically set the due date with a specified offset. So here is my <a title="Redmine-due-date-offset" href="https://github.com/9thport/redmine-due-date-offset">github repo</a> with the plugin&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to fill in the due date for all projects. I have some plans&nbsp;to improve the plugin into being a module for custom project based settings. Perhaps some settings of setting the offset value in a field and a checkbox for making sure it falls on a weekday or not.
