<p>Organized bags and packs always gravitate my attention to see if the item will stand up to my needs while traveling. Over the years I have noticed that my style of traveling, two things need to change:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the suitcase and backpack</li>
<li>my computer</li>
</ol>
I have stubbled across some potential candidates for my travel gear change:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Osprey+Pack+Meridian+28&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Osprey Pack Meridian 28"/75L Wheeled Travel Pack</a></li>
<li>Netbook PC to go inside the backpack</li>
</ol>
Waiting for some newer technology for the Netbooks is holding me back from buying one today. Once NVidia puts their mobile chip out to replace those silly Intel video chips, I think I will be ready to buy one. Since I have large hands, here are my choices:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.acer.us/acer/product.do?link=oln85e.redirect&amp;changedAlts=&amp;kcond48e.c2att101=-1&amp;CRC=2759084358#wrAjaxHistory=0">Acer InspireOne</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/products.html?n=0">Asus Eee PC 1005HA</a></li>
</ol>
So far, I like the 11 in. Acer for its full size keyboard.
