This morning I almost yelled out "that is so @#%*ing awesome" at work because the multiple line editing in Sublime Text 2 is so cool. Below are the notes of what I found out about this amazing setup.

## The situation

I was making a change to a content of code when there was a variable that I wanted to replace.

## The action

Highlight the pattern of text you want to replace. Then hit:

CTRL + CMD + g

You should notice your selection has expanded out to all of the occurences of the patten of text you highlighted. From here you can replace the text or do some limited moving of the input cursor to change its position to another area of editing.
