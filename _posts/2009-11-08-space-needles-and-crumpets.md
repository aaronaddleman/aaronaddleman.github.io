<p>This morning we went to the spcae needle. It was great because there were  it many people around the attraction. During my photo taking at the top, I did not realize that Iapped the ring twice. This was I due to three things running through my mind:
1 it was cold and I could only operate my iPhone with out my gloves
2 my battery was getting low
3 had many photos to take
Here is my end result.
