<p>This image of some people hanging out on their deck of a bunch of steel shipping containers attached together is damn well freaking cool. I would so live in a place like this. Easy to build! Pretty much water tight if you make sure vents are sealed correctly. Hanging pictures... get a drill and some bolts and nuts or even a magnet!! Moving? Put them on trucks or a boat. Bolt back up together when your done (and run the pipes and stuff). Ugh, if I was in there, I would feel like I am dreaming.
If anyone has some extra shipping containers, please let me know!
