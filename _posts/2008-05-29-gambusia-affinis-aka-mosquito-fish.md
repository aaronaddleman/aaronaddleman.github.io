# Gambusia affinis (aka mosquito fish)

<p>I do not appreciate mosquitoes. I think you might agree with me on this (if you are human and not conducting some type of funky experiment that you are getting paid in large amounts of money due to mosquitoes). I won't go in to specific detail on how I managed to find a <a title="Are you raising mosquitos in your back yard?" href="http://www.sccgov.org/SCC/docs%2FVector%20Control%20District%20%28DIV%29%2Fattachments%2F635820ARE%20YOU%20RAISING%20Mosquitoes%20for%20website.pdf">pdf that has some information on how to&nbsp;manage mosquitoes around the home</a>, but there are these Gambusia affinis that eat the mosquito eggs! According to the pdf, the fish dont need to be fed (not quite sure about that...) but you can get these fish for free as they are distributed by the local county to keep the mosquito population under control. Awsome!</p>
