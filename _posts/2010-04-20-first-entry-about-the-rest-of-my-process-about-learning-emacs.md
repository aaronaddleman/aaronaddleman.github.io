<p>Okay. It has been a long time now that I have needed to learn EMacs. So I have created a task for myself to learn one new thing about EMacs every day. So while this might be a repeating simple and stupid tasks, I have decided to log them down into a tag collection so that later on I can review them for enhancing and memory.
Currently I am using Carbon Emacs on my mac book pro. So far I have not used it much but in the past couple of days, I have been forcing myself to get out of my patterns and into something new.
The tags I will be using to cover all of the things I learn on the way will be "lessons emacs".
Hopefully, I can keep all this in my head!</p>
