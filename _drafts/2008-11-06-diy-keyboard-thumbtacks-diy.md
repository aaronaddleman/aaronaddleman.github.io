# DIY Keyboard Thumbtacks [DIY]

<p>This is totally cool!!! I have to do this for my desk setup at home! My favorite is the CTRL one. Hey, if you make enough of them, you could also spell out stuff or have little short cuts. Numbers would naturally represent priorities. Not sure what you could do with the F keys. But I love this idea. Brilliant!!
DIY web site Instructables posts a detailed step-by-step guide for re-purposing the keys from an old keyboard as thumbtacks. All you'll need to pull it off is the keyboard, round-topped push pins, a drill, and some hot glue. It's quick, easy, and decidedly cool if you've got a nostalgic kick for retro computing.
