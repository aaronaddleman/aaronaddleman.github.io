<p style="text-align: left;">I dont agree with the name of this house but I am happy that I found some plans to draw ideas off and start illustrating my house made from containers. I think my next step would be to make some drawings and also talk to an architect to see how much land I would need and build a quick estimate of how much this entire project would cost.</p>
