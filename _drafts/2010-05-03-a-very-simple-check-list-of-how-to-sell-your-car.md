I sold my car recently and here is the check list I used:

* I need to
** put "vehicle is sold as is without any guarantee or warranty"
** bring with me during the sale
*** title
*** smog certification
*** additional documentation
*** release of liability from dmv
*** recent receipt from mechanic

* Stuff I want from the buyer
** cash or cashiers check
** hold their keys while they test drive my car
** current drivers license

* What I do after selling the car
** submit release of liability to DMV
** cancel insurance
