<p>This is my 4th batch of home brewing and I have to say its my best so far. I have included its recipe for anyone to view incase they are curious to try and make it. Again, I ended up with less than 5 gallons, but it still came out really good. Perhaps the fact that I ended up with less than 5 gallons was a good thing, but I will be trying this recipe again.
