<p>I have been recently reading the book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Upgrade-Your-Life-Lifehacker-Working/dp/0470238364/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1257190931&amp;sr=8-1"><span id="btAsinTitle">Upgrade Your Life: The Lifehacker Guide to Working Smarter, Faster, Better</span></a>, by Gina Trapini. In the book there are tons of suggestions on how to save time and headaches in your life. For myself, I have found the hacks to very rewarding! Somethings in my life are very tedious and need to be streamlined. Recently, I found that my email system needed a nice ironing. So, I did some quick google searches and did not find much help on how to move message really easy via the keyboard. Thus, I set out to find my own solution. That solution is keyboard shortcuts for os x mail. This helps in saving time, and here is how to implement it for one folder:
To make a short cut for moving a message to a folder:
</p>
<ol>
<li>open system preferences</li>
<li>select "keyboard" module</li>
<li>select "keyboard shortcuts"</li>
<li>select "application shortcuts" on the left side</li>
<li>add a new entry for the "Mail" application</li>
<li>make the menu title to be the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>exact</strong></em></span> spelling and capitolization as the folder you want to move messages to</li>
<li>choose a keyboard shortcut (tip: use cmd+alt+ctrl+(letter) to avoid overlap)</li>
<li>relaunch mail to recognize the shortcut(s)</li>
</ol>
<strong>update</strong>: I have noticed that sometimes, mail does not recognize the keyboard shortcut until after you have used the menu item. This is very upsetting.
Choose a message and hit your keyboard shortcut. Volia! I hope you saw your message dissapear. If not, I suggest you try picking a new keyboard shortcut and relaunching mail or making sure the shortcut is recognized. To verify if your shortcut is being recognized, try the following:
<ol>
<li>open your mail application</li>
<li>select the "Message" menu</li>
<li>select "Move To" menu</li>
<li>find the folder you are targeting with your shortcut</li>
<li>check to make sure your menu has your shortcut next to it (refer to the screenshot below for an example)</li>
</ol>
