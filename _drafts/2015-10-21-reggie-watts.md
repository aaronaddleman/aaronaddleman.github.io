its not so much
as so little
has to do with
what everything is
but it is within self-interest
to understand the topography
of our lives unto ourselves

the future states that there is no time
other than the collapsation of that sensation
of the mirror of the memories in which we are living

common knowledge
but important none the less

as we face fear in these times
and fear is all around us
we also have anti-fear
it's hard to imagine or measure
the background radiation is simply too static
to be able to be seen under normal spectral analysis

tomorrow is another day
not just any day
but it is a day
it will get here
there's no question
and the important thing to remember
is that this simulation is a good one
it's believable, it's tactile
you can reach out - things are solid
you can move objects from one area to another
you can feel your body
you can say "i'd like to go over to this location"
and you can move this mass of molecules through the air
over to another location, at will
that's something you live inside every day

Now with the allocation and the understanding
of the lack of understanding,
we enter into an new era of science
in which we feel nothing more
than so much as to say that those within themselves,
comporary or non-comporary,
will figurativly figure into the folding of our non-understanding
and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source
and conclusions from

feel not as though
it is a sphere we live on,
rather an infinite plane which as the illusion
of leading yourself back to the point of origin
once we understand that all spheres in the sky
are just large infinite planes
it will be plain to see...ha-ha

just remember
everything you are
it's more than important
to realize the negative space
as music is only the division of space
it is the space we are listening to divided as such,
which gives us the information in comparison to something other
that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted
wants to be
