<h3>The general about portable emacs</h3>
It's so nice to have my own emacs config or app with me at any time that is on my hard drive. You can download it from:
http://portableapps.com/node/22195
Before installing, I suggest you look into the whole portable apps suite because it creates some default directories on your portable device where the .emacs and .emacs.d files live. Please continue reading below for more info. 
<h3>Configuring portable emacs</h3>
If you have installed the portable apps starter kit, the .emacs and .emacs.d files will be located in x:\documents directory (replace x with the drive letter of your portable drive letter).
