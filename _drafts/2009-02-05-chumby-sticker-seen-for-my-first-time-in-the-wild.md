<p>On my way to work I saw a Chumby sticker!! I was so excited that I took a picture with my iPhone.
I really want to get a chumby for my desk at work. Why at work? Because that's where I will see it the most. Pehaps I could have it at home but I am not in any one place for long amounts of time to have a Chumby be in my area of vision. 
Seeing the chumby sticker put such a big smile on my face this morning. I think today will be good no matter what happens.
