<p>Man, for every time I &nbsp;wanted to paste code into my Wordpress blog entries, my face and brain would cringe at the thought of "great, what is going to happen now?" ... until I found two plugins that actually work!
First I will list off what they are, then go into why I like them, and how simple to use them:
</p>
<h4>What they are</h4>
<ol>
<li>Code Markup</li>
<li>Visual Code editor</li>
</ol>
<h4>Why I like them:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Simple to use</li>
<li>Formatting stays between HTML and Visual views</li>
<li>It actually works</li>
</ol>
<h4>How to use them:</h4>
After installing the plugins and you have your snippet of code you want to insert, goto the HTML view, and type &lt;code&gt; then paste in your snippet and follow it with &lt;/code&gt;. Its that simple and easy. Hit save and drink some tea. Oh no! I forgot my tea sitting on the counter!
