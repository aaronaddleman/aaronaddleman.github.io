Back in days when I used Linux as my primary OS desktop, I got tired of using the mouse and stumbled upon this manager. It was awesome. I think later mouse support was added for moving apps around between tiles, but everything has been designed for using the keyboard. I should try it out again and see if any of the shortcuts strike some memories. Some day...
