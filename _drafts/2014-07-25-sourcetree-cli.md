## What

When using Source Tree for the Mac, I noticed there is an option for installing a CLI based tool that is called `stree`. This allows for launching Source Tree from a terminal prompt which can save a couple of clicks.

## Why

There are no fancy arguments that you can pass to the `stree` program, other than just the path you want to have added in SourceTree, but I like that I can make a new git area and add the folder into SourceTree.

## How

To install the command line tool you can do the following:

1. Go to the SourceTree app menu
1. Click on `Install Commandline Tool`
1. Type in your admin credentials
