<p>I really like this idea of slowing down music and have heard it used by Brian Eno many times when he creates is music, but I never would have imagined to slow down music I dont like lol.</p>
<p>-Update- 2011-01-15: Well, just when I thought the internet was safe... (im being sarcastict), the cloud sends me a fail whale of deleting one of my top favorite songs!!! WTF internet!? Anyways, I have now uploaded this song to my server for my own (and others) streaming pleasure. Enjoy.</p>
<p>-Upate- 2011-01-24: Whohooo!! NPR found this topic to be <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/23/133123382/super-stretched-songs-produce-cosmic-results">worthy of broadcasting</a>. I find this fantastic!! Also, I discovered that there is another very nice and popular track of the Jurassic Park theme slowed down to 1000%. This time though, I will link to both the soundcloud and my own just in case the cloud decides to kick it.</p>
