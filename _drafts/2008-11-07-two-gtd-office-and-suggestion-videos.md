<p>I came across two videos that have a guy talking about how he setup his office and notes workflow. I am very impressed and would like to use his methods for my setup at home. So, I would say that I am going to implement these changes tonight and hopefully have it done by Sunday? So I can feel good about myself completing it done early hahaha. Okay thats cheating...but anyways, here are the videos:
