<p>I would be lost with out my regexp, but writing them is sometimes very daunting. In the past I have tried many different regular expression builders or testers and ran into limitations of the wrong operating system, price is too high, or just plain bad application. Thankfully gskinner.com built an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gskinner.com/RegExr/">Online Regular Expression Testing Tool</a> and there is also a desktop version written in Adobe Air.</p>
