<p>This is not going to be some long post about the reasons why I am zipping up files with passwords. Also, opening these zip files with the Finder will yield an error. So, this is all work for the terminal command line. If you do not like that, then I am guessing that you have or need some type of program that will handle this all for you.
<span style="font-family: terminal,monaco;">zip -e filename.zip path/filepattern.*</span>
to unzip the file
<span style="font-family: terminal,monaco;">unzip filename.zip</span></p>
