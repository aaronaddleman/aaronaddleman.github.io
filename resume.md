# Resume

# Summary

I have been working with computers for over 15 years now and been self taught. Mostly engaged in UNIX or Linux systems and somewhat with MS Windows. My goals are to support a infrastructure with the knowledge and expertise that I have gained from being a systems administrator while improving security and methods of data storage or access.
I really enjoy using Ruby on Rails to make strong web applications. Each time I learn something new in Rails, its great feeling where I want to do more!
