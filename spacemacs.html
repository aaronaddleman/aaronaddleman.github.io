<h2>Overview</h2>

Spacemacs brings two communities together under one roof. The VIM and the EMACS people can try to exist in harmoney.

Just kidding, they hate each other. But to-each their own. For now, Here are some features I have found to be amazing that help me master the Spacemacs features I have come to use many times over.

{% for e in site.spacemacs %}
<div>
  <h3 class="scrollspy section blue-text text-darken-2" id="{{ e.title | downcase | replace: " ", "-" }}" >{{ e.title }}</h3>
    <span>{{ e.description }}</span>
    {{ e.content }}
</div>
<hr>
{% endfor %}
