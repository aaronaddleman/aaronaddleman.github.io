  An editor with a twist on the conflict between Emacs and Vim, and my notes about how to make it useful.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Spacemacs brings two communities together under one roof. The VIM and the EMACS people can try to exist in harmoney.

Just kidding, they hate each other. But to-each their own. For now, Here are some features I have found to be amazing that help me master the Spacemacs features I have come to use many times over.

{% for e in site.spacemacs %}
<div class="spacemacs"> 
  <h2>{{ e.title }}</h3>
  {{ e.content }}
</div>
{% endfor %}
