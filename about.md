Self taught computers at a young age, I enjoy solving problems by creating a solution(s) for the team to utilize to its fullest potential. The motto "plan to re-plan" is a constant reminder to me that things will not stay the same. My history of working with computers starts with MSDOS 3.11 and in the later years I found Linux and never really looked back to Windows (except only on curiosity). My other motto is "the best solution/tool is the one that fits" which reminds me to keep learning in order to provide better solutions.
